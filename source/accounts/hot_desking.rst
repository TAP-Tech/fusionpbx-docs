Hot Desking

A way to change the extension assigned to your handset or device without using the http management or provisioning portals, in other words, change the extension using the buttons on the phone.  This is also known as "extension mobility" or "hoteling."  This can be useful in a call center or conference room environment where a device is shared among multiple users, each with their own unique extension.
